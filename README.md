# _P214_AS3935-LightningSensor-MOD1016
AS3935 Lightning Sensor on ESP-Easy

This sketch is meant to develop the possibility to read data from the MOD-1016 with a AS3935 chip
The AS 3935 is able to detect lightning frequency and distance
This data I will make available to ESP Easy so it can be easily adapted in domoticz
You might think that it will warn you or power down equipment, also for making a weatherstation this is a nice hardware
For arduino there are several sketches available already, with this prject I want to port them to ESP8266
