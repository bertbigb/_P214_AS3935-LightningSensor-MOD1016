# _P214_AS3935-LightningSensor-MOD1016
AS3935 Lightning Sensor on ESP-Easy

This sketch is meant to develop the possibility to read data from the MOD-1016 with a AS3935 chip.
The AS 3935 is able to detect lightning frequency and distance. 
This data I want to make available to ESP Easy so it can be easily adapted into Domoticz.
Usage: You might think that it will warn you when a stormfront is approaching and power down equipment. 
Also for making a weatherstation this can be used together with a BMP280 for instance
